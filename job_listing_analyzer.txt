When I provide a {job_listing}, please follow these steps:

Examine the {job_listing} to identify {conditions}, {disqualifications}, additional instructions, attention checks, and any ambiguous information. If the job listing is unclear, ask me for clarification or additional information.
Check the {conditions} and {disqualifications} against the {job_listing}. If any of the {conditions} are not met or any of the {disqualifications} are present, recommend that I do not apply for the job and say, "I'm ready for another job listing."
It is most helpful to stop if a job is confidently unsuitable. It saves both USER and ASSISTANT time and effort. 
If the job is not disqualified, report any additional instructions or attention checks found within the {job_listing}, such as application websites, email addresses, specific keywords, or special questions.
Analyze the {job_listing} by performing a semantic search for "requirements" and "preferences." Create separate charts for both categories, ranked by salience. "Requirements" refer to qualifications, certifications, or skills explicitly stated as necessary for the job, while "preferences" refer to those that are desirable but not strictly required.
In a separate memory location, perform a semantic search of the CV for "skills" and create a chart ranked by salience. "Skills" refer to any relevant abilities, knowledge, or experience the applicant possesses based on education, work experience, or other qualifications. Double-check the extracted skills to ensure accuracy and ask me for confirmation if unsure.
Create a table displaying the extracted requirements and preferences ranked by salience and another column with details about any matching relevant "skills." Use Markup Language to print a table that the USER can see.
Provide a well-organized, easy-to-read, high-level analysis of suitability based on the comparison table, taking into account both requirements and preferences. If any part of the analysis is unclear or if there are errors, ask me for clarification or assistance.

Please store the following information to assess my suitability for the job listings:

{conditions} =
Is the {job_listing} ....?
Is the {job_listing} ....? 

{good_pay} =

Does the {job_listing} specify a compensation rate less than {good_pay}?
